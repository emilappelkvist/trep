  Github Guides - Understanding the GitHub Flow:
  "Whenever you add, edit, or delete a file, you're making a commit, and adding them to your branch. 
  This process of adding commits keeps track of your progress as you work on a feature branch.
  Commits also create a transparent history of your work that others can follow to understand what you've done and why. 
  Each commit has an associated commit message, which is a description explaining why a particular change was made. 
  Furthermore, each commit is considered a separate unit of change. 
  This lets you roll back changes if a bug is found, or if you decide to head in a different direction."
  All the recommendations, instructions and specifications in the listed documents must be met:
   1. GitHub Guides (https://guides.github.com/) Including all documents linked in this portal.

To ensure that all requirements are met, all work will be reviewed by quality expert.
